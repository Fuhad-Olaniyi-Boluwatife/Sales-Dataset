# E - Commerce Sales Dataset

## Introduction 

This is an open dataset, provided by *Pragmatic World*, that contains comprehensive sales records from a typical e-commerce operation. It captures various facets of sales activities, with key data points including unique identifiers for products, customers, and manufacturers, along with other essential transaction details.

Each record represents a specific sales event, detailing the transaction date, the number of units purchased, and financial metrics such as unit cost and unit price. Additionally, the dataset enriches product insights with information like product names, categories, market segments, and manufacturer details.

To provide deeper geographical context, the dataset also includes location-based data for each transaction, such as zip code, city, state, region, district, and country, enabling robust spatial analysis

By leveraging this dataset, I have analyzed sales trends, explored customer behaviour, and assessed geographical performance, uncovering valuable insights to guide strategic decisions. The dashboard below presents key findings and interactive visualizations, enabling deeper exploration of the dataâ€™s potential.
