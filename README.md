## Introduction

This is an open dataset, provided by *Pragmatic World*, that contains comprehensive sales records from a typical e-commerce operation. It captures various facets of sales activities, with key data points including unique identifiers for products, customers, and manufacturers, along with other essential transaction details.

Each record represents a specific sales event, detailing the transaction date, the number of units purchased, and financial metrics such as unit cost and unit price. Additionally, the dataset enriches product insights with information like product names, categories, market segments, and manufacturer details.

To provide deeper geographical context, the dataset also includes location-based data for each transaction, such as zip code, city, state, region, district, and country, enabling robust spatial analysis.

Here is the look of the dataset

By leveraging this dataset, I have analyzed sales trends, explored customer behaviour, and assessed geographical performance, uncovering valuable insights to guide strategic decisions. The dashboard below presents key findings and interactive visualizations, enabling deeper exploration of the dataâ€™s potential.

## Statement of Problem

This is to see how we can optimize product and regional performance by identifying high-value customers, best-selling product segments, and underperforming areas over time.





## Tools and Methodology

Microsoft Power BI and Power Query;

- **Data Preparation**: Performed data normalization, extraction, and cleaning using **Power Query**.
- **Data Modeling**: Built a **star schema** in **Microsoft Power BI** for optimized analytics.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Leveraged **DAX** to create calculated columns, custom measures, and a dynamic **calendar table** for time intelligence in Microsoft Power BI.
- **Visualization**: Developed interactive dashboards to transform raw data into actionable insights using Microsoft Power BI.
